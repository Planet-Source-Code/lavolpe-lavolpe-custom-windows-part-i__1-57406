### Description

Part 1. Prequel to a full-blown skinning application. This part does not skin but attempts to completely control the window non-client area. Provided in hopes you will help identify any bugs on different O/Ss. Works well on 98/2K. The other parts of this project will be submitted after bugs fixed in this part and feedback has been addressed. Part 2 will be skinned version compatible with MDIs, Part 3 will include routines for custom-drawn menus. Heavily subclassed and heavily commented; but still a work in progress. Feedback is definitely requested especially pertaining to bugs and suggestions.
